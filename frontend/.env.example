# API URL Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: Leave this EMPTY for same-domain deployment!
# The frontend code already includes /api prefix in API calls.
# Setting this to /api would cause double prefix: /api/api/...
#
# For same-domain deployment (recommended):
VITE_API_URL=
#
# For cross-domain deployment (separate API server):
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yoursite.com
